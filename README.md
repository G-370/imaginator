# Imaginator

This is another small python script I made, but this time its main function is to render a text file as an image, representing each byte as a pixel, then
scaling the image 10x. 

## Usage

Install the Pillow lib for python 3:

`python -m pip install --upgrade pillow`

Use the script like:

python imaginator.py txtfile

txtfile is the name of the file you want to turn into an image.
